        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Use crushed, crisp rice cereal squares instead of panko crumbs with gluten-free wraps for a gluten-free version!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup panko crumbs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Sea Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pound chicken breasts, one at a time in a resealable freezer bag, until about 1/2-inch thick. Lightly beat egg in a shallow bowl. Combine panko crumbs, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts in egg until coated, drip off excess, and dip in panko mixture. Press chicken into crumbs until fully coated. Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Transfer chicken to pan and cook about 2 to 3 minutes per side or until chicken is brown, crispy and fully cooked. Transfer to a plate and cut into strips. </li>
            <li>Honey Mustard: Combine mayonnaise, yellow mustard, Dijon mustard, honey and lemon juice in a small bowl. Combine desired amount of chicken, honey mustard, bacon, lettuce, grapes, shredded cheddar cheese, green onions and sliced almonds in tortillas. Wrap up and serve. </li>
